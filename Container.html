<h3 id="what-is-container">What is Container?</h3>
<p>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.</p>

<td>1.VM is piece of software that allows you to install other software inside of it so you basically control it virtually as opposed to installing the software directly on the computer.</td>

<td>2.Applications running on VM system can run different OS.</td>
<td>While applications running in a container environment share a single OS.</td>

<tr>
<td>3.VM virtualizes the computer system.</td>
<td>While containers virtualize the operating system only.</td>

<tr>
<td>4.VM size is very large.</td>
<td>While the size of container is very light; i.e. a few megabytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5.VM takes minutes to run, due to large size.</td>
<td>While containers take a few seconds to run.</td>

<td>6.VM uses a lot of system memory.</td>
<td>While containers require very less memory.</td>

<tr>
<td>7.VM is more secure.</td>
<td>While containers are less secure.</td>

<tr>
<td>8.VMâ€™s are useful when we require all of OS resources to run various applications.</td>
<td>While containers are useful when we are required to maximise the running applications using minimal servers.</td>
</tr>
