<h2 id="what-is-kubernetes">What is kubernetes?</h2>
<p>The open-source platform Kubernetes orchestrates and automates the setup, operation and scaling of container applications. The architecture allows the  containers to be orchestrated across multiple machines, whether they are virtualized hardware or bare metal.</p>

<p>Kubernetes continuously monitors the state of the applications and ensures that it corresponds to the specified descriptions: For example, if the descriptions specify that three instances should always be executed as web servers, Kubernetes keeps exactly three instances running. If an instance fails or a process crashes, Kubernetes restarts this instance. Even if an entire work process fails or cannot be reached, Kubernetes restarts it from a new node.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is structured according to the so-called master-slave architecture. The master component controls the nodes on which the containers run. The Kubernetes architecture includes:</p>
<h2 id="the-project-“borg”-becomes-kubernetes">The project “Borg” becomes Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Google relied on containers and their advantages in many ways – even independently of Docker. In order to manage (or orchestrate) containers sensibly, the employees developed the “Borg” project. Star Trek fans know the meaning of the name: it is a collective that is not organized hierarchically, because all Borg are connected to each other. We’ll learn later what that means for Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Borg was an undisputed competitive advantage of Google because it utilized the machines much better than purely virtualized operations. Google strengthened its market position by being able to provide huge infrastructure landscapes at a much lower cost.</p>
<p>The big hit for the general public was the idea of making Borg available as an open-source solution. Kubernetes (Greek for helmsman; short: K8 or K8s) was born.</p>
